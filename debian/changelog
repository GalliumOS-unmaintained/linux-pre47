linux-image-4.1.14-galliumos (26) vivid-galliumos; urgency=medium

  * First version of changelog
    - This is not (and might never be) a full debian tree
    - Build script uses this changelog to set variable(s) at build time
      - KDEB_PKGVERSION ("26") is set from package version string
      - LOCALVERSION ("-galliumos") could be parsed from package name
    - Debian packaging only reads the first changelog entry, so it is
      safe to change the package name and downrev the version string
